This distribution contains the library and utility programs in support of the
NIST IREX test. Some of the functionality provided by the library and programs
requires other libraries to be installed. The IREX library requires that the
Jasper JPEG-2000 and GD library and header files be installed. Jasper and GD
are often available as a installable package on many systems. 
Alternatively, GD can be obtained from http://www.boutell.com/gd/
and Jasper can be obtained from http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/

NOTE: As of October 2009, this package is no longer being maintained and
exists for historical reasons only. The last version of code herein is that
used for the NIST IREX 2008 Evaluation.
