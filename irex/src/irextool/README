The irextool program uses the Jasper library to manipulate the images contained
in the IREX record. Jasper can be found at:
http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/

Installation of Jasper is required in order to build irextool. Jasper is often
included in the OS package system or ports systems for FreeBSD, OS-X, or Linux.
