This package contains applications that use the BIOMDI libraries to process
biometric data obtained from smart cards, or as part of a NIST evaluation
program. Summaries are provided below:

smartcard	Libraries and tools to communicate with smart cards and 
		manipulate tag-length-value objects. An implementation of the
		personal computer smart card (PC/SC) specification needs to
		be installed prior to building the smart card tools. On Linux
		and Mac OS-X systems, pcsclite is typically used.

matchoncard	Tools and example test drivers used for the NIST Match-on-Card
		evaluation. Uses the smart card library.

irex		Tools and libraries used in the NIST IREX evaluation. See
		http://iris.nist.gov/irex/

irexsdkv	An example test driver for the NIST IREX evaluation.

piv		Libraries and tools used to manipulate and verify components
		of the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) records. Uses the
		smart card library.
