This distribution contains a library to verify components of the Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) records. The PIV library validates the CBEFF header.
The pivv program validates a PIV record that contains minutiae records.
PIV fingerprint minutiae records conform to the INCITS 378-2004 standard,
and therefore, the pivv program uses the FMR library contained in the
BIOMDI fingerminutiae package.
See www.csrc.nist.gov/piv-program/index.html for information on the PIV program.

This package requires some packages from the BIOMDI distribution. You must
build and install the common, fingerminutiae, fingerimage, and
facerecognition libraries before building this PIV package. The BIOMDI
distribution is available from http://fingerprint.nist.gov/

Also required is the smartcard package from the BIOMAPP distribution that
includes this PIV package. The PIV build system assumes that the smartcard
package is installed; if not, you can change the make files that define
the COMMONINCOPT and COMMONLIBOPT to add the location of the smartcard
include and library files. See common.mk file for details.

The top-level make file will build all packages in the correct order.

OS-X includes PCSC development headers after installing "Command Line Tools,"
or by building with xcrun. Refer to Apple Technical Note TN 2339 for details:
