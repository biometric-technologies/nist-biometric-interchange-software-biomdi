WARNING: gcc version 3.3.6 (Debian 1:3.3.6-15) has a serious bug where
floating point operations are generated incorrectly. The result is that
the ISO CC templates my have zero values for coordinates, or angles.
The bug is manifested in the FMR library conversion routines, but because
the MOC code uses these routines, the end result is bad CC records.
Testing with gcc 3.4.6 (Debian 3.4.6-5) generates correct CC records.

To test the generation of CC records, execute the fmr2fmr program that
is part of the BIOMDI package:
fmr2fmr -i B2Example.raw -ti ANSI -o B2Example.CC -to ISOCC

and examine the output CC file:
prfmr -ti ISOCC B2Example.CC
