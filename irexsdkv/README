The irexsdkv is a "virtual" package for the IREX SDK test driver, that is
(mostly) integrated from the packages used by the irexSDKv program.
This package's directory can be tar'd/ZIP'd/etc. and copied to the
test systems en-masse for convenience, negating the need to have the
BIOMDI and BIOMAPP packages installed. This virtual package should
build stand-alone, except for the normal system dependencies.

NOTE: As of October 2009, this package is no longer being maintained and
exists for historical reasons only. The last version of code herein is that
used for the NIST IREX 2008 Evaluation.
